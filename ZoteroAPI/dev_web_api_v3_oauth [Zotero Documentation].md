## OAuth Key Exchange

In addition to users manually creating Zotero API keys from the zotero.org account settings, Zotero supports [OAuth](http://oauth.net/ "http://oauth.net/") 1.0a for API key exchange.

## Registering Your Application

In order to start using OAuth to create API keys on behalf of users, you must [register your application with Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/oauth/apps "/oauth/apps") to obtain a Client Key and Client Secret for use during all future OAuth handshakes between your application/website and zotero.org. Note that after you obtain an API key for a particular user these client credentials are not required for further Zotero API requests.

## Requesting Specific Permissions

You can request specific permissions be allowed for your app by sending values to the new key form as GET values in the URL during the OAuth exchange. The possible values to pre-populate for a user are:

- name (the description for the key)
- library\_access (1 or 0 - allow read access to personal library items)
- notes\_access (1 or 0 - allow read access to personal library notes)
- write\_access (1 or 0 - allow write access to personal library)
- all\_groups (none, read, or write - allow level of access to all current and future groups)
- identity=1 Don't create a key. Instead, use OAuth exchange only to get the user's identity information in order to do things that require no special permissions.

## Using OAuth Handshake for Key Exchange

The OAuth endpoints for access to the Zotero API are as follow:

Rather than using OAuth to sign each request, OAuth should be used to obtain a key for subsequent requests. The key will be valid indefinitely, unless it is revoked by the user manually, so keys should be considered sensitive. Note, however, that the Zotero API uses exclusively HTTPS requests, so ordinary traffic will not expose the key.

In addition to receiving the token, API consumers using OAuth will need to retrieve the user's user ID from the response parameters returned by Zotero.org.

### Example (PHP)

This PHP script demonstrates an implementation the application side of the OAuth handshake with zotero.org, using the API key thus obtained to make a request to the Zotero API.

```php
/** Note that this example uses the PHP OAuth extension http://php.net/manual/en/book.oauth.php
* but there are various PHP libraries that provide similar functionality.
*
* OAuth acts over multiple pages, so we save variables we need to remember in $state in a temp file
*
* The OAuth handshake has 3 steps:
* 1: Make a request to the provider to get a temporary token
* 2: Redirect user to provider with a reference to the temporary token. The provider will ask them to authorize it
* 3: When the user is sent back by the provider and the temporary token is authorized, exchange it for a permanent
*    token then save the permanent token for use in all future requests on behalf of this user.
*
* So an OAuth consumer needs to deal with 3 states which this example covers:
* State 0: We need to start a fresh OAuth handshake for a user to authorize us to get their information.
*         We get a request token from the provider and send the user off to authorize it
* State 1: The provider just sent the user back after they authorized the request token
*         We use the request token + secret we stored for this user and the verifier the provider just sent back to
*         exchange the request token for an access token.
* State 2: We have an access token stored for this user from a past handshake, so we use that to make data requests
*         to the provider.
